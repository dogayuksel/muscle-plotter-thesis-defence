*** HASOMED EMS Machine
    8 Channel 400Hz
*** handwriting recognition and spatial interactions
    tesseract
*** closed control loop for output
**** 1st Step
     Finding the proportion relation
**** 2nd Step
     System Limitations
**** 3nd Step
     Working with the human


* user study
** study preparation
   Selection of curves
** evaluation and results
   results


* application perpective pen and paper interactions
** development process
   design considerations
** wind tunnel, math plots, forms, filter design...
   wind tunnel
   filter design

* limitations and future work
** ems difficulties
   ems machines haven't seem much improvement
** improve ems
   muscle Sync
*** Hardware level improvements in next years
**** array of electrodes
     ease of use and flexibility
**** internal positioning model
     compansate for orientation changes
**** internal calibration
     adjust intensity with position feedback

* Discussion?
  Questions?
