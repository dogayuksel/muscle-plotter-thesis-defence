* 1) Muscle-Plotter
   - is an interactive system
   - based on electrical muscle stimulation
   - produces spacial output
** 
   #+ATTR_HTML: :class highlight
   builds on previous EMS systems to create an interface that enables elaborate sensemaking tasks
** 
   #+ATTR_HTML: :class highlight
   provides such an interface in very small form factors

* 2) related work (5 mins)
** pen and paper stuff
   - teddy
   - mit actuated table

** ems stuff
   pose IO
   affordance ++


* 3) implementation
** pen and paper interface for input and output
  + Hardware
    1. anoto pen for paper
    2. electrical muscle stimulation
  + Software
    1. control loop
    2. application api
    
*** Anoto Pen and Paper

*** HASOMED EMS Machine
    8 Channels sharing upto 400 pulses per second

*** Pad Placement
    Horizontal axis
    #+CAPTION: Left and Right
    #+ATTR_HTML: :alt Left and Right :title horizontal :align left :width 90%

*** Pad Placement
    Vertical axis
    #+CAPTION: Up and Down
    #+ATTR_HTML: :alt Up and down :title vertical :align left :width 90%

*** handwriting recognition and spatial interactions
    tesseract
*** closed control loop for output
    non linear system
*** Proportional Controller
    - Only one channel is active at a given time
    - signal intensity is mapped to min and max situmulation values
*** Muscles explode
    - more chaos then control
*** Finding a reliable range
    - Active situmulation on both sides
    - repetative testing, 3 stages
*** On Paper
   #+CAPTION: Sketches on Paper
   #+ATTR_HTML: :alt Range Sketches on Paper :title draw on paper :align left :width 90%

*** Analysis
   #+CAPTION: Angle Range Analysis
   #+ATTR_HTML: :alt Angle Range :title range :align left :width 90%
   [[./img/web-viz.png]]
*** Hardware Limitations
    - Anoto, 10 samples each second
    - .1s delay
    - adjust control loop to act for every 10 anoto samples
*** Designing for the Human Operator at the end of the line
    Additional channel for brake


* 4) user study
** study preparation
   Selection of curves
   #+CAPTION: User Setup

* 5) application perpective pen and paper interactions
** development process
   design considerations
** wind tunnel, math plots, forms, filter design...
   wind tunnel
   filter design

* 6) limitations and future work
** ems difficulties
   ems machines haven't seem much improvement
** improve ems
   muscle Sync
*** Hardware level improvements in next years
**** array of electrodes
     ease of use and flexibility
**** internal positioning model
     compansate for orientation changes
**** internal calibration
     adjust intensity with position feedback

* 7) Discussion?
  Questions?
