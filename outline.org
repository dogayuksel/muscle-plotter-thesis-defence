* 2) related work (5 mins)
** pen and paper stuff
   - teddy
   - mit actuated table

** ems stuff
   pose IO
   affordance ++


* 3) implementation
** pen and paper interface for input and output
  + Hardware Overview
    1. anoto pen for paper
    2. electrical muscle stimulation
  + Software
    1. control loop
    2. application api

*** handwriting recognition and spatial interactions
    tesseract
*** closed control loop for output
**** 1st Step
     Finding the proportion relation
**** 2nd Step
     System Limitations
**** 3nd Step
     Working with the human


* 4) user study
** study preparation
   Selection of curves
** evaluation and results
   results


* 5) application perpective pen and paper interactions
** development process
   design considerations
** wind tunnel, math plots, forms, filter design...
   wind tunnel
   filter design

* 6) limitations and future work
** ems difficulties
   ems machines haven't seem much improvement
** improve ems
   muscle Sync
*** Hardware level improvements in next years
**** array of electrodes
     ease of use and flexibility
**** internal positioning model
     compansate for orientation changes
**** internal calibration
     adjust intensity with position feedback

* 7) Discussion?
  Questions?
